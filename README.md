# Dota 2 Analyzer Frontend
> Author: J.S. Pescasio

## What Is It?
Frontend code of a CS180 (Intro to Software Engineering) project. 

In this project, my group and I developed a web application that analyzed data from a ["Dota 2 Matches" database from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/dota-2-matches). I developed the frontend while the other group members developed the backend.

This was a team project (5 students per team). The goal was to build an **in-memory data store** with a **layered client-server architecture** from scratch. The data store provides predefined data analytics for gaining insights from the data. Initially, the data store can be populated with some public dataset in CSV format.

## Dataset Used
The public dataset we chose was the ["Dota 2 Matches" database from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/dota-2-matches).

## Tech Stack
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): frontend framework used for this project
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): used to make GET/POST requests to an API server
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): web framework used for the API server to connect the backend to the frontend

## 3rd Party Packages
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/): used to display the data through charts
